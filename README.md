This is not a large part of the front-end, in which the main menu of the site is presented. Animation works on the navigation menu, and the "Login" button also works, where the login and registration window appears with a slight animation. The code is protected by copyright.

html document:
1. In the header class, there is a window for quick site navigation with the nav tag.
2. Next comes the div with the wrapper class, which contains two more divs: the first one is the box login form. It contains a login window.
3. Below is the second div with the box register form class, which contains the markup of the registration window.
4. Below all these sections, the JavaScript script and the service where I took the icons are connected.

CSS document:
1. In the very top line of the code, I have included a google font.
2. Below are the parameters of resets from all sides and the designation of our field.
3. Next, with the body parameter, we set up the work area and the background image.In the header parameter, I'm setting up the top navigation bar.
4. In the logo, I set up the text, namely the name of the site in the upper left corner.
5. Next comes the navigation where I set the position, animation size and other parameters.
6. We approached the wrapper call, our login window, where the background parameters, its position and other settings are set.
7. Wrapper icon close, I adjusted the position, color and other settings of the icons.
8. In the btn parameter, the settings for the action button are specified.

JavaScript document:
1. In the first 5 lines of code, I declared constants by placing them in my classes.
2. Below, the parameters are written, where add - enable / add, and remove - disable / remove.

Above, I very briefly explained how my code works, how it interacts and how it is connected. I hope you liked my small project, I hope for support. Pull requests are welcome)
